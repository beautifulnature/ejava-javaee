  <comment>This project builds the test data sets for the eLeague system. It
        connects to an externally defined database, maps the database
        directly to eLeague DTO classes, and outputs a set of XML files to
        be used by the project&apos;s parser during the student ingest. This
        project cannot be run without a remote connection to the test
        database. Thus it is not expected to be used by the class.</comment>
