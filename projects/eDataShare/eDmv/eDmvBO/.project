  <comment>This project provides a simple test and sparse example of how to 
        define a set of business objects for use in the class project. It is
        provided primarily to show an end-to-end thread from the TestUtil to 
        business logic working with the data that was ingested. Since this is 
        a class project, Not all data will be modeled as a part of this example.</comment>
