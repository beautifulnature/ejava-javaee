  <comment>This project provides the data transfer objects and XML parser
        used to provide an initial starting point for ingesting data
        into the class database. The parser and DTOs are to be
        used to obtain data for project-specific business objects for
        ingest. Once the ingest is complete, there should not longer be
        any downstream dependency on this project or classes/interfaces
        within. A separate project is provided to provide test data. Use
        that project for your primary dependency as it will bring in
        default implementation classes for JAXB and StAX needed for
        runtime use.</comment>
