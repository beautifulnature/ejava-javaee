                Many of the command line examples listed in these instructions
                use bash syntax on Linux. You will need to translate the specific
                commands into the shell syntax that is appropriate for your 
                environment. Linux is not a requirement for class. Many students
                have taken this class and used various versions of Windows and Mac
                systems.

                It is never a good idea to install software in a directory with
                spaces in the fully qualified path name if the software contains
                jar files that will eventually be part of a classpath. I strongly
                recommend your working directory, the JDK, JBoss, and all 
                repository locations comply with this critical guideline or 
                you may suffer classpath issues at some point.
