        <para>
            Many of the command line examples listed in these instructions
            use bash syntax on Linux. You will need to translate the specific
            commands into the shell syntax that is appropriate for your 
            environment. Linux is not a requirement for class. Many students
            have taken this class and used various versions of Windows and Mac
            systems.
