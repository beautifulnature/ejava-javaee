Porting from JBoss 6.x EAP (7.x) to Wildfly 8.1.0.Final

These are the issues encountered and steps taken to port the ejava example
source tree from JBoss 6.1 EAP to Wildfly 8.1.0.Final version prior to upgrading
to any of the JavaEE 7 APIs (except an upgrade to JPA 2.1 had already been performed).

    []


* Key Issues

    [[1]] The separate remoting interface (4447) used for JNDI and other 
    RMI uses has been eliminated and replaced with their standard HTTP (8080)
    interface. 
    
    * The jndi.properties#java.naming.provider.url was changed from/to the following
    for standard JNDI-based lookups.

---
- remote://${jboss.host}:4447
+ http-remoting://${jboss.host}:8080
---

    * The jboss-ejb-client.properties#remote.connection.default.port changed 
    from/to the following for EJBClient-based lookups

---
- remote.connection.default.port=4447
+ remote.connection.default.port=8080
---

    [[1]] All library references need to be updated. Libraries that use to be 
    called jboss-as-xxx have been renamed to wildfly-xxx and all standards 
    were updated from JavaEE 6 to JavaEE 7 versions. Specific changes were isolated
    to ejava-build/jboss-rmi-client.


    [[1]] The web server implementation has been changed and required the following
    setup to enable SSL.

---
<security-realms>
    <security-realm name="ManagementRealm">
        ...
    </security-realm>
    <security-realm name="ApplicationRealm">
        ...
    </security-realm>
    <security-realm name="UndertowRealm">
        <server-identities>
            <ssl>
                <keystore path="${jboss.server.config.dir}/server.keystore" keystore-password="password"/>
            </ssl>
        </server-identities>
    </security-realm>
</security-realms>

<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:undertow:1.1">
    <buffer-cache name="default"/>
    <server name="default-server">
        <http-listener name="default" socket-binding="http"/>
        <https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" security-realm="UndertowRealm"/>
        <host name="default-host" alias="localhost">
           ...
        </host>
    </server>
    ...
</subsystem>

* Issues

    [[1]] The jboss.mgmt.port changed from 9999 to 9990. That required a change 
    to the cargo deployer configuration.

---
          <properties>
              <cargo.hostname>${jboss.mgmt.host}</cargo.hostname>
-             <cargo.jboss.management.port>9999</cargo.jboss.management.port>
+             <cargo.jboss.management.port>9990</cargo.jboss.management.port>
          </properties>
---

    [[1]] Fixed issue with example code attempting (and working in previous releases)
    to @Inject a bean into a variable that was unnecessary declared static in a Servlet
    Filter class.

---
- @Inject private static UserTransaction tx;
+ @Inject private UserTransaction tx;
---

    [[1]] JPA 2.1 requires different dependency

---
       <dependency>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.javax.persistence</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-jpa-2.1-api</artifactId>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
