    <title>SQL Queries</title>
    <para>In the previous chapter we formed queries based on JPAQL -- which are based on 
        entity and property names and the relationships defined within the entity class
        structure. In a real application, there is also a need to form queries that go 
        outside the boundaries of the entity class model -- but should still be pushed 
        to the database to perform. JPA provides us an escape hatch to execute raw SQL
        queries. However, anything returned is not in a managed state.</para>
