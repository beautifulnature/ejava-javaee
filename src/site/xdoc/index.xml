      (605.784), taught at John's Hopkins University, Engineering Programs
      for Professionals.  This site will be populated as the semester progresses
      and topics are addressed. If you are looking for a version of the full content

      <subsection name="Class To Do" id="todo">
      <ul>
        <li>read the text chapter on Entity Relationships.</li>
        <li>Update your business objects to map each of the relationships (remove the
        @Transient annotations). 
        Add either JPA @Annotations to the .java files, an orm.xml descriptor
        file, or both to map the business objects to the database. You may accept
        JPA defaults and modify your existing .ddl scripts and JDBC code or 
        provide JPA overrides to have it match your existing code.</li>
        <li>Enhance your JPA DAO Unit tests to test the ability to manipulate
        the business object relationships using your JPA DAO(s).</li>
        <li>Add initial business logic interfaces and implementation classes
        for AuctionMgmt, SellerMgmt, BuyerMgmt, and TestSupport. These implementation
        classes should delegate data access to the DAO classes.</li>
        <li>Add a JUnit test that will implements the end-to-end scenario discussed 
        at the end of the testing section of the project 1 spec. You may place this in
        a separate functional test project if you wish.</li>
      </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Things you should have finished!" id="completed">
      <ul>
      <li><ul>
        <li>updated your BLImpl project dependency to use the eSalesTestUtil,
        version 1.0.2007.1rc2. This added auction category and account e-mail
        address. It also contained sanity checked Bid ordering and moved auctions
        with the images closer to the top of all sorts.</li>
        <li>read the text chapters on the EntityManager and Mapping Entities</li>
        <li>Ignored relationships in your business objects (marked them @Transient),
        added either JPA @Annotations to the .java files, an orm.xml descriptor
        file, or both to map the business objects to the database. Accepted
        JPA defaults and modifed your existing .ddl scripts and JDBC code or 
        provided JPA overrides to have it match your existing code.</li>
        <li>Enhanced your JPA DAO Unit tests to test the ability to manipulate
        the business objects using your JPA DAO(s).</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
        <li>looked over the posted eSales test data, parser, and example thread; you
        have directly reused the eSalesTestUtil and eSalesDTO pojects; you haved looked
        over the other example sibling project for ideas on how to design your
        project.</li>
        <li>created your ingest capability by integrating with eSalesTestUtil; your
        schema may still be maturing, so your are not worry too much 
        about how much you actually write to the DB at this time.</li>
        <li>went through the entityMgrEx exercise</li>
        <li>went through the jpaDAO example</li>
        <li>created JPA DAO(s) implementation classes for your projects; designed how
        they get a shared EntityManager and implemented the CRUD methods;
        provided a persistence.xml file; defined all Collections to be @Transient
        and observed the default behavior of mapping just your Account class.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
          <li>read through project description and post any clarification
          questions</li>
          <li>went through JDBC tutorial and used this project to try out any
          test JDBC code you had questions on</li>
          <li>looked through the jdbcDAO project</li>
          <li>started your project directory tree</li>
          <li>designed your project business objects within the "BO" project areas;
          provided unit tests</li>
          <li>created the structure of the JDBC Ingest DAO within the "DAO" project
          to mature over time</li>
          <li>created the schema file for the project; to mature over time</li>
          <li>built your project from the root; all supplied artifacts should built 
          and tested correctly</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul>
          <li>registered for newsgroup and setup e-mail handling (all e-mails will have
          ejava_class in subject)</li>
          <li>posted at least 1 test message to newsgroup</li>
          <li>setup development environment by going through exercises 0 and 1</li>
      </ul></li>
