      <ul>
          <li>turn in your project 1</li>
          <li>implement any project 1 cleanup or refactoring for use
          in projects 2 and 3.</li>
          <li>download the updates to the class SVN tree to pick up
          the additional server-side projects.</li>
          <li>make sure you can start your JBoss server and have
          a ejavaDS data source configured.</li>
          <li>build the example tree from the root using 
          "mvn clean install" and report any issues encountered</li>

      <subsection name="Things you should have finished!" id="completed">
      <ul>
      <li><ul>
          <li>finish up with the JDBC ingest implementation.
          Make sure your JDBC mapping and JPA mapping stay consistent.</li>
          <li>add any necessary use of EJBQL to your projects. This 
          is normally used in cleanup methods, but could also be 
          used in various business logic queries.  </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
          <li>add relationship mappings to your business objects
          Test the ability to create, get, update, and remove
          relationships between objects.</li>
          <li>continue with the JDBC ingest implementation.
          Make sure your JDBC mapping and JPA mapping stay consistent.</li>
          <li>send a zip file of your project, in any consistent state, to
          the instructor for a sanity check. Include comments on where
          you believe you are relative to the project and the weekly class todo
          list.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
          <li>map your business objects to the database for
          objects/properties and tables/columns. Mark relationships as
          @Transient at this point. Test the ability to create, find,
          update, and delete each object type.</li>
          <li>continue with the JDBC ingest implementation.
          Make sure your JDBC mapping and JPA mapping stay consistent.</li>
          <li>send a zip file of your project, in any consistent state, to
          the instructor for a sanity check. Include comments on where
          you believe you are relative to the project and the weekly class todo
          list.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul>
          <li>complete the structure of the JDBC Ingest DAO within the "DAO" project;
          to continue to mature over time</li>
          <li>create JPA DAO(s) implementation classes for your projects;
          design how they get a shared EntityManager and implement the CRUD methods;
          provide a persistence.xml file; define all Collections to
          be @Transient and observed the default behavior of mapping classes.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
          <li>read through project description and post any clarification
          questions</li>
          <li>go through JDBC tutorial and use this project to try out any
          JDBC/SQL cwcommands you had questions on</li>
          <li>look through the example BO and DAO thread for the project</li>
          <li>start your project directory tree</li>
          <li>design your project business objects within the "BO" project areas;
          provide unit tests</li>
          <li>create the schema file for a portion of the project; to mature over 
          time</li>
          <li>create the structure of the JDBC Ingest DAO within the "DAO" project;
          to mature over time</li>
          <li>built your project from the root; all supplied artifacts should build 
          and test correctly</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul>
        <li></li>
          <li>register for newsgroup and setup e-mail handling (all e-mails will have
