      <ul>
          <li>Go through the JDBC Exercise</li>
          <li>Look over the class project and post any questions.</li>
          <li>Establish your project directory structure and perform a build from the root.</li>

          DAO. This should at least consist of a successful connection to the DB.</li>

          your DAO project.</li>
          <li>Implement a way to create your schema in the DB as a part of your DAO testing.</li>

          You only need a create() method for the project.</li>
          <li>Consider all BO, DB Schema, and DAO work as draft prototypes at this time to get
